                    Many younger Tanitians speak fluent English. Very little English is spoken in rural areas,
                    especially by the older residents.

                    There is one hospital and several clinics. The hospital has many multilingual employees.

                    Taniti enjoys a large number of national holidays, and many tourist attractions and restaurants will be closed on holidays, so visitors should plan accordingly.

                    Violent crime is very rare on Taniti, but as tourism increases, there are more reports of pickpocketing and other petty crimes.

            Almost all visitors arrive to Taniti by air, though some arrive on a small cruise ship that docks in
            Yellow Leaf Bay for one night per week. Taniti is served by a small airport that can
            accommodate small jets and propeller planes. Taniti is in the process of expanding the
            airport so larger jets will be able to land on the island within the next few years.

            Taniti uses the U.S. dollar as its currency, but many businesses will also accept euros and yen.
            Several banks facilitate currency exchange, and many businesses accept major credit cards.
