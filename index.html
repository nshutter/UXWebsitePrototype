                    Taniti is a small, tropical island in the Pacific. While the island has an area of less than 500 square
                    miles, the terrain is varied and includes both sandy and rocky beaches, a small but safe harbor, lush
                    tropical rainforests, and a mountainous interior that includes a small, active volcano. Taniti has an
                    indigenous population of about 20,000. Until a recent increase in tourism,
                    most the Tanitian economy was dominated by fishing or agriculture.
